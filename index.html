<p>Welcome to the MVC Quick Start!</p>
<p>To get started you&#39;ll need the following pre-requisites:</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows computer</li>
<li><a href="https://visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio 2015</a></li>
<li>TFS Repository </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="about-asp-net-mvc-and-mvc-architecture">About ASP.NET MVC and MVC Architecture</h3>
<p>ASP.NET MVC gives you a powerful, patterns-based way to build dynamic websites that enables a clean separation of concerns and that gives you full control over markup for enjoyable, agile development. ASP.NET MVC includes many features that enable fast, TDD-friendly development for creating sophisticated applications that use the latest web standards.</p>
<p>The Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main components: the model, the view, and the controller. The ASP.NET MVC framework provides an alternative to the ASP.NET Web Forms pattern for creating Web applications. The ASP.NET MVC framework is a lightweight, highly testable presentation framework that (as with Web Forms-based applications) is integrated with existing ASP.NET features, such as master pages and membership-based authentication. The MVC framework is defined in the System.Web.Mvc assembly.</p>
<p>MVC is a standard design pattern that many developers are familiar with. Some types of Web applications will benefit from the MVC framework. Others will continue to use the traditional ASP.NET application pattern that is based on Web Forms and postbacks. Other types of Web applications will combine the two approaches; neither approach excludes the other.</p>
<p>The MVC framework includes the following components:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Models.</strong> Model objects are the parts of the application that implement the logic for the application&#39;s data domain. Often, model objects retrieve and store model state in a database. For example, a Product object might retrieve information from a database, operate on it, and then write updated information back to a Products table in a SQL Server database.
In small applications, the model is often a conceptual separation instead of a physical one. For example, if the application only reads a dataset and sends it to the view, the application does not have a physical model layer and associated classes. In that case, the dataset takes on the role of a model object.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Views.</strong> Views are the components that display the application&#39;s user interface (UI). Typically, this UI is created from the model data. An example would be an edit view of a Products table that displays text boxes, drop-down lists, and check boxes based on the current state of a Product object.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Controllers.</strong> Controllers are the components that handle user interaction, work with the model, and ultimately select a view to render that displays UI. In an MVC application, the view only displays information; the controller handles and responds to user input and interaction. For example, the controller handles query-string values, and passes these values to the model, which in turn might use these values to query the database.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The MVC pattern helps you create applications that separate the different aspects of the application (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), while providing a loose coupling between these elements. The pattern specifies where each kind of logic should be located in the application. The UI logic belongs in the view. Input logic belongs in the controller. Business logic belongs in the model. This separation helps you manage complexity when you build an application, because it enables you to focus on one aspect of the implementation at a time. For example, you can focus on the view without depending on the business logic.</p>
<p>The loose coupling between the three main components of an MVC application also promotes parallel development. For example, one developer can work on the view, a second developer can work on the controller logic, and a third developer can focus on the business logic in the model.</p>
<h3 id="features-of-the-asp-net-mvc-framework">Features of the ASP.NET MVC framework</h3>
<p>The ASP.NET MVC framework provides the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Separation of application tasks (input logic, business logic, and UI logic), testability, and test-driven development (TDD). All core contracts in the MVC framework are interface-based and can be tested by using mock objects, which are simulated objects that imitate the behavior of actual objects in the application. You can unit-test the application without having to run the controllers in an ASP.NET process, which makes unit testing fast and flexible. You can use any unit-testing framework that is compatible with the .NET Framework.</p>
</li>
<li><p>An extensible and pluggable framework. The components of the ASP.NET MVC framework are designed so that they can be easily replaced or customized. You can plug in your own view engine, URL routing policy, action-method parameter serialization, and other components. The ASP.NET MVC framework also supports the use of Dependency Injection (DI) and Inversion of Control (IOC) container models. DI enables you to inject objects into a class, instead of relying on the class to create the object itself. IOC specifies that if an object requires another object, the first objects should get the second object from an outside source such as a configuration file. This makes testing easier.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Extensive support for ASP.NET routing, which is a powerful URL-mapping component that lets you build applications that have comprehensible and searchable URLs. URLs do not have to include file-name extensions, and are designed to support URL naming patterns that work well for search engine optimization (SEO) and representational state transfer (REST) addressing.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for using the markup in existing ASP.NET page (.aspx files), user control (.ascx files), and master page (.master files) markup files as view templates. You can use existing ASP.NET features with the ASP.NET MVC framework, such as nested master pages, in-line expressions (&lt;%= %&gt;), declarative server controls, templates, data-binding, localization, and so on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Support for existing ASP.NET features. ASP.NET MVC lets you use features such as forms authentication and Windows authentication, URL authorization, membership and roles, output and data caching, session and profile state management, health monitoring, the configuration system, and the provider architecture.</p>
</li>
</ul>

				<h2 id="nuget-and-source-control">NuGet and Source Control</h2>
<p>You shouldn&#39;t source control NuGet packages, but configuring this correctly in TFS can be confusing. This section shows how to do this.</p>
<h3 id="add-nuget-config-file">Add NuGet.config file</h3>
<p>First, we&#39;ll need to create a nuget.config file that disabled nuget source control integration. This will go into a folder named <code>.nuget</code> in the base of your branch.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add a nuget.config file to your repository
</h4>

<p>Add a <code>.nuget</code> folder to the base of your repository.</p>
<p>After adding the <code>.nuget</code> folder, add a file named <code>nuget.config</code> to the folder. Add the following to the file:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-xml">&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;configuration&gt;
  &lt;solution&gt;
    &lt;add key=&quot;disableSourceControlIntegration&quot; value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/solution&gt;
&lt;/configuration&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Commit this to your source control repository.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="ignoring-nuget-packages-in-source-control">Ignoring NuGet packages in source control</h3>
<p>Next, we need to add a <code>.tfignore</code> file to the root of your branch. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>The <code>.tfignore</code> files is a file that tells TFS which files and fodlers should be excluded from source control.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add a .tfingore file 
</h4>

<p>Add a <code>.tfignore</code> file to the base of your repository.</p>
<p>Add the following to the file:</p>
<pre><code>\packages
!\packages\repositories.config
</code></pre><p>This file tells TFS to ignore the contents of the folder named <code>\packages</code>, but to include the repositories.config file. </p>
<p>The repositories.config file includes special information about your NuGet packages repositories. Not all projects need this file, but we add it to the inclusion list just in case your project needs it.</p>
<p>Commit this to your source control repository.</p>
